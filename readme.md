# Laravel Blogdown

This package enables you to write content in Markdown and display it in your **Laravel 5.*** application. You can also use this package to build a simple blog.

## Main Features
* No database / migrations needed
* Pre-renders the content for speed
* Automatically detects changes in markdown files
* Works out of the box
* Simple to use

## Install

Require this package through composer:

```
composer require swiftmade/blogdown
```

If you're using Laravel < 5.5, then you'll need to register the service provider in your config/app.php

```php
Swiftmade\Blogdown\Providers\BlogdownProvider::class
```
	
If you want to change the default blog folder (*defaults to resources/views/blog*), use `php artisan vendor:publish` to publish the config file.

## Use

### Format

Here is a sample blog article:

```markdown
/*
slug: this-is-your-slug
title: Title of My Article
keywords: any keywords, you want to add, here
description: you can add any tag you want
date: 19.02.2017
custom: hey! I can access this like $blog->meta->custom
*/

# Title of My Article

** Bold Text **

Hey, this is my first blogdown article. Here is a list:

* It's awesome
* It just works!
```

### Building

You need to put your markdown files (with .md extension) inside the blog folder (see install notes for configuration). Afterwards, you need to run the following artisan command:

```
php artisan blog:build
```

This command is necessary when you add a new article or when you want to flush the entire cache and rebuild it. Blogdown automatically detects a modification to an existing article, so no need to run this when you modify your articles.

### Retrieving Articles

The only meta tag required by Blogdown is *slug*. The package uses this tag as a unique identifier across all your markdown files. While retrieving your blog article, you pass in this slug like this:

```php
use Swiftmade\Blogdown\Facades\Blogdown;


Blogdown::find('this-is-your-slug');
```

And in return you get this object:

```php
stdClass Object
(
    [meta] => stdClass Object
    (
	[path] => /path/to/your/file.md
	[slug] => this-is-your-slug
	[title] => Title of My Article
	[keywords] => any keywords, you want to add, here
	[description] => you can add any tag you want
	[date] => 19.02.2017
    )
    [html] => Your HTML code
)
```

In your view file just display your rendered HTML unescaped:

```php
{!! $blog->html !!}
```

### Adding custom modifiers

Sometimes you might like to modify the output of the HTML using your own custom tags. For example you might like to replace any instance of the string [AD] with the HTML for an advert unit. You can do this by adding a customer modifier.

```php
namespace App\BlogModifiers;

use Swiftmade\Blogdown\Contracts\ModifierInterface;

class AdvertModifier implements ModifierInterface
{

    public function apply($html)
    {
        $advertCode = '<p>Buy stuff from Company X</p>';
        return str_replace('[AD]', $advertCode, $html);
    }

}
```

Make sure you have published the config for blogdown (`php artisan vendor:publish`). Add your modifier to the list of modifiers.

```php
'modifiers' => [
	\Swiftmade\Blogdown\Modifiers\TableModifier::class,
	\App\BlogModifiers\AdvertModifier::class,
],
```
